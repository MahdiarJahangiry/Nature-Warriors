# Nature-Warriors
Nature Warriors is the name of a group of inhabitants of the planet who come together to protect the planet Earth.

This is a hack-and-slash game with semi open world map, the game contains many hero characters with different variations each with their own unique fighting style and special abilities and combos.

Our heroesâ€™ weapons and fighting styles are chosen by their native and one of our priorities for the character design is based on the animal species, which are in danger of extinction in that region.

Each hero is tasked with some missions to stop the fire invasion, hunt can kill special bosses of the game.

Allies can be summoned as an AI NPC to aid the player while fighting tough battles and hard bosses.


Another Unfished project because of low budget. We event try the Kickstare for that one but we was unexprienced and didn't have acssess to most famous game sites 
to promote us because of you know US Saniction and they didnt collabrate with us .
